The possible trajectories of this test particle are described by a distribution function that spreads out in phase space as time increases. A convergent kinetic equation which accounts for long-range collective effects and short-range collisions in a consistent manner is derived to describe the time evolution of the distribution function. Expressions for the energy loss rate and dynamical friction are calculated from appropriate moments of the kinetic equation, and they show how the Coulomb logarithm, ln $\Lambda$, varies with the velocity of the test particle. The errors introduced by the use of a convergent kinetic equation are estimated, and these indicate that the kinetic equation method gives the test particle\&apos;s diffusion in phase space only on coarse grained time and spatial scales. For the case of a fast electron, the time scale must be larger than the electron plasma period and the spatial scale larger than e 2/KT.},

Those runaway beams carried about 46\% of the plasma current and located around the q~=~2 rational surface when m/n~=~1/1 and m/n~=~2/1 MHD modes existed in the plasma. Those runaway beams changed from a hollow to a filled structure during the slow oscillations in the discharge about every 0.2~s, which correlated with a large step-like jump in electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals, a big spike-like perturbation in Mirnov signals and a large decrease in runaway energy. Between those slow oscillations with large magnitude, fast oscillations with small magnitude also existed about every 0.02~s, which correlated with a small step-like jump in ECE signals, a small spike-like perturbation in Mirnov signals, but no clear decrease in runaway energy and changes in the runaway beam structure. Resonant interactions occurred between runaway electrons and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, which gave rise to fast pitch angle scattering processes of those resonant runaway electrons, and hence increased the synchrotron radiation. Theoretical calculations of the resonant interaction were given based on a test particle description. Synchrotron radiation of those resonant runaway electrons was increased by about 60\% until the end of the resonant interaction.},

A theoretical model and a numerical algorithm for the runaway dynamics in phase space are developed. Instead of standard integrators, such as the Runge{\textendash}Kutta method, a variational symplectic integrator is applied to simulate the long-term dynamics of a runaway electron. The variational symplectic integrator is able to globally bound the numerical error for arbitrary number of time-steps, and thus accurately track the runaway trajectory in phase space. Simulation results show that the circulating orbits of runaway electrons drift outward toward the wall, which is consistent with experimental observations. The physics of the outward drift is analyzed. It is found that the outward drift is caused by the imbalance between the increase of mechanical angular momentum and the input of toroidal angular momentum due to the parallel acceleration. An analytical expression of the outward drift velocity is derived. The knowledge of trajectory of runaway electrons in configuration space sheds light on how the electrons hit the first wall, and thus provides clues for possible remedies.},

In an investigation of the runaways generated in disruptions in JET, detailed time and space resolved X ray images of the runaway beam in flight have been obtained for the first time and these allow a detailed diagnosis and analysis of the production and movement of the runaways. These measurements are now possible because of the development, for the JET DT campaign, of radiation protected soft X ray cameras. The measurements show that the runaways are generated at the vessel centre in a region with small minor radius and they then move to interact with a small area of the wall. The observed radiation power both in detectors installed in the torus and in the radiation protected cameras shows reasonable agreement with values calculated from the runaway current and energy. The current density profile and q profile of the runaway beam are also determined. After the start of the disruption there is a delay before the onset of runaway generation and this may offer control possibilities.},

We perform test particle simulations of relativistic electrons interacting with EMIC waves with a fixed frequency and a rising-tone frequency such as EMIC triggered emissions observed in the inner magnetosphere. Trapping of resonant electrons leads to rapid and efficient pitch angle scattering of relativistic electrons, resulting in bursty precipitation of relativistic electrons. The efficiency of the pitch angle scattering depends on the gradient of the magnetic field, the frequency sweep rate, and the wave amplitude. The effective wave trapping occurs for a wide range of pitch angles from 10 to 60 degrees. The most effective pitch angle scattering takes place for the case of a rising-tone emission with an enhanced magnetic field gradient. Since the efficiency of pitch angle scattering also depends on the wave amplitude, resonant electrons may not be scattered into the loss cone in a single passage through the wave packet. However, repeated interactions with a series of wave packets result in scattering of relativistic electrons into the loss cone.},

Under some reasonable regularity conditions, we prove that the semi-discrete scheme can achieve second-order convergence in approximating the FBSDEs of interest; and such convergence rate does not require jump-adapted temporal discretization. Next, to add in spatial discretization, a fully discrete scheme is developed by designing accurate quadrature rules for estimating the involved conditional mathematical expectations.

The ITPA MHD group is conducting a joint experiment to measure the RE detection threshold conditions on a number of tokamaks under quasi-steady-state conditions in which V loop, n e, and REs can be well-diagnosed and compared to collisional theory. Data from DIII-D, C-Mod, FTU, KSTAR, and TEXTOR have been obtained so far, and the consensus to date is that the threshold E-field is significantly higher than predicted by relativistic collisional theory, or conversely, the density required to damp REs is significantly less than predicted, which could have significant implications for RE mitigation on ITER.},

For Compton scattering, the general case, the Thomson limit, and the extreme Klein-Nishina limit are considered. Bremsstrahlung is treated for the cases where the electron is scattered by a pure Coulomb field and by an atom. For the latter case the effects of shielding are discussed extensively. The synchrotron spectrum is derived for an electron moving in a circular orbit perpendicular to the magnetic field and also for the general case where the electron's motion is helical. The total photon-production spectrum is derived for each process when there is a power-law distribution of electron energies. The problems of the effects of the three processes on the electron distribution itself are considered. It is shown that if the electron loses a small fraction of its energy in a single occurrence of a process, the electron distribution function satisfies a continuity equation which is a differential equation in energy space. For the more general case where the electron can lose energy in discrete amounts (as in bremsstrahlung and extreme Klein-Nishina Compton losses), the electron distribution function satisfies an integro-differential equation. Some approximate solutions to this equation are derived for certain special cases.},

Analytical expressions are derived for the electron distribution function in plasmas with the electric field close to critical, which is typical of plasmas with grassy sawteeth on the Joint European Torus. A numerical solution is used for determining the normalization constant, which matches the relativistic region onto the weakly relativistic region. It is found that the scaling of the runaway rate with the electric field obtained by Connor and Hastie is a good approximation in spite of their use of an incomplete form of the collision operator not conserving number of particles. The present analysis determines the proportionality constant and introduces corrections to the earlier scaling of the runaway rate with respect to the electric field. The results obtained for the electron distribution function constitute a basis for studies of experimentally observed phenomena in near-threshold electric fieldplasmas with a significant suprathermal electron population.},

In TEXTOR disruptions runaway losses were enhanced by the application of resonant magnetic perturbations with toroidal mode number n=1 and n=2. The disruptions are initiated by fast injection of about 3{\texttimes}1021 argon atoms, which leads to a reliable generation of runaway electrons. At sufficiently high perturbation levels a reduction of the runaway current, a shortening of the current plateau, and the suppression of high energetic runaways are observed.

In the regimes considered, a finite fraction of the electron population has magnetically trapped orbits, and is not appreciably affected by the applied electric field, while the distribution of circulating electrons tends to slide away as a whole. Then the Spitzer-H{\"a}rm model for the current-carrying electron distribution is inadequate, and the role that collective modes, in particular current-driven microinstabilities, and collisions can play in producing a stationary electron distribution is analysed. Modes at the ion plasma frequency, $\omega$pi, that are driven by the positive slope of the current-carrying electron distribution, can be excited, when the average electron drift velocity is a finite fraction of the electron thermal velocity, and transfer transverse energy to the main body of the electron distribution. These features are consistent with the experimental observations performed on the Alcator device. Modes at the reduced electron plasma frequency (k{\textbar}{\textbar}/k)$\omega$pe can also be excited both in connection with the modes at $\omega$pi and independently. Modes at the electron gyrofrequency $\Omega$e associated with the loss-cone feature that the electron distribution tends to develop are considered, among others, as a factor for the strongly enhanced electron cyclotron emission experimentally observed in regimes where non-thermal electron distributions have been realized.},

Analysis of synchrotron intensity from a camera indicates that the tail of the runaway energy distribution reaches energies up to 60 MeV, which agrees with 0D modeling of electron acceleration in the toroidal electric field generated during the current quench. A visible spectrometer provides an independent estimate of the upper limit of runaway electron energy which is roughly consistent with energy determined from camera data. Synchrotron spectra reveal that approximately 1\% of the total post-thermal quench plasma current is carried by the detected high-energy runaway population with energies in the range of 25{\textendash}60 MeV; the bulk of the plasma current thus appears to be carried by relativistic electrons with energy less than 25 MeV.

	abstract = {We study the problem of electron-ion temperature equilibration in plasmas. We consider pure H at various densities and temperatures and Ar-doped H at temperatures high enough so that the Ar is fully ionized. Two theoretical approaches are used: classical molecular dynamics (MD) with statistical two-body potentials and a generalized Lenard-Balescu (GLB) theory capable of treating multicomponent weakly coupled plasmas. The GLB is used in two modes: (1) with the quantum dielectric response in the random-phase approximation (RPA) together with the pure Coulomb interaction and (2) with the classical (?{\textrightarrow}0) dielectric response (both with and without local-field corrections) together with the statistical potentials. We find that the MD results are described very well by classical GLB including the statistical potentials and without local-field corrections (RPA only); worse agreement is found when static local-field effects are included, in contradiction to the classical pure-Coulomb case with like charges. The results of the various approaches are all in excellent agreement with pure-Coulomb quantum GLB when the temperature is high enough. In addition, we show that classical calculations with statistical potentials derived from the exact quantum two-body density matrix produce results in far better agreement with pure-Coulomb quantum GLB than classical calculations performed with older existing statistical potentials.},

This is the case near the divertor plates, during impurity pellet injection, during controlled discharge disruptions, etc. The calculation of impurity radiation is a fairly involved task (it is sometimes the most difficult part of the general problem) because the radiation power is determined by the distribution of ions over the excited states and by the rate constants of elementary processes of radiation and absorption. The objective of this paper is to summarize in one place all the approximate formulas that would help investigators to describe radiation from the most often encountered impurities in a fairly simple way in their calculations accounting for plasma radiation, without reference to special literature. Simple approximating formulas describing ionization, recombination, and charge-exchange processes, as well as radiative losses from ions with a given charge, are presented for five impurity species: beryllium, carbon, oxygen, neon, and argon. Estimating formulas that allow one to take into account plasma opacity for resonant photons in line impurity radiation are also presented.},

A Langevin approach, including collisional diffusion in velocity space, will be used to analyze the two-dimensional runaway electrondynamics. An investigation of the runaway probability in velocity space will yield a criterion for runaway, which will be shown to be consistent with the results provided by the more simple test particle description of the runaway dynamics [Fuchs et al., Phys. Fluids 29, 2931 (1986)]. Electron perpendicular collisional scattering will be found to play an important role, relaxing the conditions for runaway. Moreover, electron pitch angle scattering perpendicularly broadens the runaway distribution function, increasing the electron population in the runaway plateau region in comparison with what it should be expected from electron acceleration in the parallel direction only. The perpendicular broadening of the runaway distribution function, its dependence on the plasma parameters, and the resulting enhancement of the runaway production rate will be discussed.},

This model permits a rigorous systematic analysis of the problem, devoid of arbitrary elements, in the limit of weak electric field. The analysis leads to a decomposition of velocity space into three regions. In the first of these, the low velocity domain, the electron distribution function is dominated by collisions and hence almost isotropic; it obeys a diffusion equation driven by the applied field. The second region, one of intermediate velocity, is characterized by quasi-steady flow in velocity space, for which the low velocity region provides the source. Lastly there is a high velocity region, fed by the intermediate region, in which the electrons run away almost freely under the action of the electric field, with only an exceedingly weak diffusion due to collisions. The problem is solved explicitly in the first and third regions and reduced to solving a single ``universal\&apos;\&apos; partial differential equation in the second region. The runaway rate, number of runaway electrons, and electric current density (average electron velocity) are obtained explicitly.},

To mitigate disruption-induced problems it has been proposed that 'killer' pellets could be injected into the plasma in order to safely terminate the discharge. Killer pellets enhance radiative energy loss and thereby lead to rapid cooling and shutdown of the discharge. But pellets may also cause runaway electron generation, as has been observed in experiments in several tokamaks. In this work, runaway dynamics in connection with deuterium or carbon pellet-induced fast plasma shutdown is considered. A pellet code, which calculates the material deposition and initial cooling caused by the pellet is coupled to a runaway code, which determines the subsequent temperature evolution and runaway generation. In this way, a tool has been created to test the suitability of different pellet injection scenarios for disruption mitigation. If runaway generation is avoided, the resulting current quench times are too long to safely avoid large forces on the vessel due to halo currents.},

	abstract = {A detailed analysis of the spectra of synchrotron radiation emitted by runaway electrons, and an analysis of synchrotron radiation spot shapes are presented for EAST runaway cases. Conditions required for the asymptotic expressions of synchrotron radiation spectra to be valid are studied for these EAST parameters. We provide the correct synchrotron radiation spectra in typical EAST discharges, and we show results of calculations of the shape of the synchrotron radiation spots emitted by runaway electrons. These shapes are detected by a visible light camera in EAST. Safety factor q(r), the horizontal displacement of electron drift surfaces with respect to the magnetic surfaces $\delta$ e , pitch angle $\theta$ p , and the position of the camera were taken into account. Our results indicate that the $\theta$ p and q profiles can significantly affect the synchrotron radiation spot shape; it is simpler to record all synchrotron radiation if the camera is placed far from the plasma. An asymmetrical synchrotron radiation spot shape can be deduced when the effect of the drift orbit shift is taken into account. Our results can explain the asymmetrical ring-like synchrotron radiation spot shape from runaway electron beams in EAST experiments.},

Through the transport, RMP influences the time dynamics and preferred loss directions of the REs, which are determined for different magnetic perturbation configurations. The distribution of the field mesh exit points of the REs become more localized compared with the unperturbed case, since the loss pattern depends on the geometric properties of the RMP configuration such as periodicity or helicity. On the other hand, the loss patterns do not depend on the particle energies and starting positions. The particle radial steps are correlated with the local radial magnetic perturbation component, which makes the transport chaotic, but deterministic.},

The fast electron dynamics during current drive in tokamaks and reverse field pinches can be investigated in detail by coupling this calculation to a bounce-averaged relativistic Fokker{\textendash}Planck solver, which calculates the electron distribution function. The asymmetry between high- and low-field side hard x-ray emission intensity that has been measured on the Tore-Supra tokamak [Equipe TORE SUPRA, in Proceedings of the 15th Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, Seville (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1995) Vol. 1, IAEA-CN-60/A1-5 (Institute of Physics, Bristol, U.K., 1995), p. 105] is explained for the first time by the role of trapped electrons. A much stronger poloidal asymmetry is predicted for the line-integrated fast electron bremsstrahlung in the poloidal plane of the Madison Symmetric Torus [R. N. Dexter et al., Fusion Tech.19, 131 (1991)], since the helical winding of the magnetic field lines is much larger for a reverse field pinch configuration.

Recent observations from Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and a reanalysis of older observations from the Solar Maximum Mission, have led to important new results concerning the location, timing, and efficiency of particle acceleration in flares. These are summarized in the first part of the review. Particle acceleration processes are then discussed, with particular emphasis on new developments in stochastic acceleration by magnetohydrodynamic waves and direct electric field acceleration by both sub- and super-Dreicer electric fields. Finally, issues that arise when these mechanisms are incorporated into the large-scale flare structure are considered. Stochastic and super-Dreicer acceleration may occur either in a single large coronal reconnection site or at multiple {\textquotedblleft}fragmented{\textquotedblright} energy release sites. Sub-Dreicer acceleration requires a highly filamented coronal current pattern. A particular issue that needs to be confronted by all theories is the apparent need for large magnetic field strengths in the flare energy release region.},

This anisotropy is a source of free energy that may destabilize electromagnetic waves through a resonant interaction between the waves and the energetic electrons. In this work, we investigate the high-frequency electromagnetic waves that are destabilized by runaway electron beams when the electric field is close to the critical field for runaway acceleration. Using a runaway electron distribution appropriate for the near-critical case, we calculate the linear instability growth rate of these waves and conclude that the obliquely propagating whistler waves are most unstable. We show that the frequencies, wave numbers, and propagation angles of the most unstable waves depend strongly on the magnetic field. Taking into account collisional and convective damping of the waves, we determine the number density of runaways that is required to destabilize the waves and show its parametric dependences.},

Raising the density during a discharge does not avoid EF penetration, so long as RE growth proceeds to the critical level. Penetration is preceded by non-thermalization of the electron cyclotron emission, anisotropization of the total pressure, synchrotron emission shape changes, as well as decreases in the loop voltage and bulk thermal electron temperature. The same phenomena occur despite various types of optimal EF correction, and in some cases modes are born rotating. Similar phenomena are also found at the low-density limit in JET. These results stand in contrast to the conventional interpretation of the low-density stability limit as being due to residual EFs and demonstrate a new pathway to EF penetration instability due to REs. Existing scaling laws for penetration project to increasing EF sensitivity as bulk temperatures decrease, though other possible mechanisms include classical tearing instability, thermo-resistive instability, and pressure-anisotropy driven instability. Regardless of the first-principles mechanism, known scaling laws for Ohmic energy confinement combined with theoretical RE production rates allow rough extrapolation of the RE criticality condition, and thus the low-density limit, to other tokamaks. The extrapolated low-density limit by this pathway decreases with increasing machine size and is considerably below expected operating conditions for ITER. While likely unimportant for ITER, this effect can explain the low-density limit of existing tokamaks operating with small residual EFs.},

	abstract = {Modelling high-pressure gas flows through long extended delivery tubes used for massive particle fuelling of tokamaks during a major disruptive instability or a preemptive fast plasma shutdown is presented using analytical theory and simulation. For steady-state flows, expressions were derived and compared with experiments for the transition diameter and inlet Mach number of a straight tube (pipe) attached to a 'nozzle-like' inlet valve, such that increases in pipe diameter have no effect on the flow rate (valve-limited flow), and decreases below the transition diameter cause decreasing flow rates (friction-limited flow). Analytical expressions for the exit outflow rate and other gas dynamic variables during the initial unsteady gas flow buildup were developed from the classical 1D centred expansion wave problem and compared with 2D axisymmetric FLUENT simulations with wall friction, and good agreement was found for sufficiently high-conductance pipes. The intrinsic time delay before steady-state outflow is reached can seriously limit plasma density increases during the disruption, as the disruption time scale is similar to the delay time or 'rise time' of the outflow at the exit plane. Thus, conditions required for strong collisional dissipation of destructive runaway electron currents can be compromised. A unique gas injection scheme 'burst membrane gas injection' is also presented in which a steady-state outflow at the exit plane can be established promptly once the membrane bursts. It is shown that the theoretically ideal rise time of the gas at the exit plane will be zero if the membrane had an instantaneous opening time, therefore the true rise time will be limited only by the rupture time of a real bursting disc. The duration of the initial steady-state gas delivery phase can be matched to the relevant disruption time scales (or runaway formation time) by simply adjusting the tube length.},

	abstract = {Extremely low density operation free of error field penetration supports the excitation of trace-level quiescent runaway electron (RE) populations during the flat-top of DIII-D Ohmic discharges. Operation in the quiescent regime allows accurate measurement of all key parameters important to RE excitation, including the internal broadband magnetic fluctuation level. RE onset is characterized and found to be consistent with primary (Dreicer) generation rates. Impurity-free collisional suppression of the RE population is investigated by stepping the late-time main-ion density, until RE decay is observed. The transition from growth to decay is found to occur 3{\textendash}5 times above the theoretical critical electric field for avalanche growth and is thus indicative of anomalous RE loss. This suggests that suppression of tokamak RE avalanches can be achieved at lower density than previously expected, though extrapolation requires predictive understanding of the RE loss mechanism and magnitude.},

In this work we use a suprathermal electron distribution appropriate for the case when the accelerating electric field is near-critical and we investigate the frequencies, wave numbers and propagation angles of the most unstable waves using a general dispersion relation. It is shown that if the electric field is sub-critical, the anisotropy is not enough to drive electromagnetic waves unstable, as the Landau damping of the waves overwhelms the drive through the anomalous Doppler resonance. In the case when the electric field is supercritical, two types of electromagnetic waves will be destabilized, the electron-whistler and the extraordinary electron wave. The number of electrons for destabilization of the latter is several orders of magnitude lower than for the electron-whistler wave. Consequently, the threshold for destabilization of the extraordinary electron wave is much lower.},

It is shown that both the runaway generation process and the maximum runaway energy can be noticeably affected by magnetic fluctuations.

As an application of this theory, the dynamics of runaway electrons is examined and a steady-state solution is constructed describing a balance between acceleration by the electric field, pitch-angle scattering, and radiationreaction. Furthermore, it is found that a beam of relativistic electrons can be slowed down by the combined effects of pitch-angle scattering and radiationreaction. This damping can be more efficient than ordinary collisional drag, and appears to explain the decay of post-disruption runaway currents in the Joint European Torus (JET) [R. D. Gill, Nucl.

The electron velocity distribution is assumed to be isotropic but not necessarily Maxwellian and the effects of electron-ion collisions are included. The results show how the presence of a small number of energetic electrons can enhance the intensity of the fluctuations near the plasma frequency, provided the Landau damping resulting from these energetic electrons is greater than both the collision damping and the Landau damping caused by the ambient electrons. The results are applied to the ionosphere radar-backscatter experiments, where the energetic electrons are photoelectrons produced by solar uv radiation. In the case of the Arecibo radar experiments, the intensity of the fluctuations near the electron plasma frequency is estimated to be enhanced at plasma frequencies greater than about 4 or 5 Mc/sec.},

A symplectic mapping procedure in symmetric form is developed which allows a fast and accurate characterization of the Poincar{\'e} plots in poloidal cross sections. It is shown that the stochastic magnetic field acts differently on the onset of chaotic motion for co- and counterpassing particles, respectively. Resonant drift surfaces are shifted inward for the co-passing particles, and are shifted outward for the counterpassing particles, when compared with resonant magnetic surfaces. The overall result is an inward (outward) shift of chaotic zones of co-passing (counterpassing) particles with respect to the magnetic ergodic zone. The influence of a stationary radial electric field is discussed. It shifts the orbits farther inward for the co-passing particles and outward for the counterpassing particles, respectively. The shifts increase with the energies of the particles. A rotation of the magnetic field perturbations and its effect on drift motion is also investigated. Estimates for the local diffusion rates are presented. For applications, parameters of the dynamic ergodic divertor of the Torus Experiment for Technology-Oriented Research are used [Fusion Eng.

The rate at which this occurs is determined by the flow of particles from the collision-dominated to the electric-field-dominated region of velocity space. The probability, Q($\tau$), of electron runaway as a function of time is calculated with the help of the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation and can be expressed in the form Q($\tau$)=1-exp(-$\lambda$1$\tau$). The runaway rate, $\lambda$1, is presented as a function of applied electric field, and the plasma temperature and density. It exceeds by several orders of magnitude the rate recently proposed by Harrison.

The reconstructions also indicate that the RE pitch angle $\theta$ is not uniform, but tends to be large at low energies and small $\theta$ \~{} 0.1{\textendash}0.2 at high energies. Overall power loss from the RE plateau appears to be dominated by collisions with background free and bound electrons, leading to line radiation.

The power spectrum of {\v C}erenkov radiation exhibits sharp peaks not only at the frequencies of the lower and upper hybrid resonances but also at those frequencies at which the ray phase velocity equals the particle\&apos;s velocity, v ||, parallel to the magnetic field. An intriguing feature of this radiation is that the more slowly the particle moves along the magnetic field, the greater is the emitted radiation; the power emitted in the whistler mode also becomes large when v || equals the group speed of those waves that are beamed along the magnetic field.

However, for the same numerical accuracy, the adjoint method is more efficient than the Monte Carlo method. The expected slowing-down time gives a novel method to estimate the runaway current decay time in experiments. A new result from this work is that the decay rate of high energyelectrons is very slow when E is close to the critical electric field. This effect contributes further to a hysteresis previously found in the runaway electron population.},

Under clean wall conditions, one observes at low densities not only the runaway electrons with energies up to 30 MeV and at discharges with even lower electron density one finds more runaway electrons but at an energy in the low-MeV regime. The runaway electrons are utilized as test particles for revealing the ergodized magnetic field line structure. For the measurements the m/n = 6/2 base mode configuration of the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED), has been applied. One observes a clear modification of the radial runaway profile with preferential losses in the ergodized zone. From the loss rate of the runaway electrons due to ergodization and from the redistribution of the runaways after the DED phase, the diffusion rate is estimated to be of the order of 0.1 m2 s-1.},

The dynamical friction force exerted by the electrons and ions upon each other through the agency of two-body Coulomb encounters is evaluated. In this connection the electrons and ions have been assigned Maxwellian velocity distributions which are displaced from each other by their relative drift velocity. This treatment yields a dynamical friction force which maximizes when the relative drift velocity is equal to the sum of the most probable random electron and ion speeds. For relative drift velocities in excess of this value the friction force decreases rapidly. As a consequence, it is found that a fully ionized gas cannot exhibit the steady-state behavior characterized by time independent drift velocities which has previously been accredited to it by other authors. Instead, it is shown that the electron and ion currents flowing parallel to the existing magnetic fields increase steadily in time (i.e., runaway) as long as a component of the electric field persists along the magnetic field. Drift velocities which greatly exceed the random speeds of the plasma particles can be created in this manner.},

Before the final design is chosen for the mitigation system to prevent such a transfer, it is important that the parameters that control the physics be understood. Equations that determine these parameters and their characteristic values are derived. The mitigation benefits of the injection of impurities with the highest possible atomic number Z and the slowing plasma cooling during halo current mitigation to ?40 ms in ITER are discussed. The highest possible Z increases the poloidal flux consumption required for each e-fold in the number of relativistic electrons and reduces the number of high energy seed electrons from which exponentiation builds. Slow cooling of the plasma during halo current mitigation also reduces the electron seed. Existing experiments could test physics elements required for mitigation but cannot carry out an integrated demonstration. ITER itself cannot carry out an integrated demonstration without excessive danger of damage unless the probability of successful mitigation is extremely high.

A simple model, which assumes that the runaways take over the current density in the centre of the discharge, successfully describes these measurements. This model is applied to JET and ITER. One interesting result of the model is that it could be favourable for ITER to have a high runaway production. This leads to a lower runaway energy and less runaway damage. Quantitative predictions are sensitive to the value of the runaway parameter = E/Ecrit, which is determined by the post-disruption temperature. The present estimate for ITER gives = 0.02, which results in a maximum runaway energy of 300 MeV in a runaway beam with a total energy of 500 MJ. However, if is enhanced, these values will be reduced. An increase to = 0.04 is sufficient to decrease the maximum runaway energy to 55 MeV and the total beam energy to 130 MJ.

Asymmetries in poloidal halo and toroidal plasma current can now be routinely measured in four positions 90{\textdegree} apart. Their assessment is used to validate the design of the ITER vessel support system and its in-vessel components. The challenge of disruption thermal loads comes from both the short duration over which a large energy has to be lost and the potential for asymmetries. The focus of this paper will be on localized heat loads. Resonant magnetic perturbations failed to reduce the generation of REs in JET. An explanation of the limitations applying to these attempts is offered together with a minimum guideline. The REs generated by a moderate, but fast, Ar injection in limiter plasmas show evidence of milder and more efficient losses due to the high Ar background density.},

Matching of solutions before and after the kicks establishes a symplectic map which exactly describes the evolution. The generating function associated with this map satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The solution of this equation is found in first order of perturbation theory. It is shown that the map reproduces correctly Poincar{\'e} sections and statistical properties of typical orbits. It is shown that the well known perturbed twist mapping and, in particular, the standard map may be obtained from the symmetric map as an approximation.

It would be desirable to have a runaway electron suppression method which is passive, i.e., a method that does not rely on an uncertain disruption prediction system. One option is to let the large electric field inherent in the disruption drive helical currents in the wall. This would create ergodic regions in the plasma and increase the runaway losses. Whether these regions appear at a suitable time and place to affect the formation of the runaway beam depends on disruption parameters, such as electron temperature and density. We find that it is difficult to ergodize the central plasma before a beam of runaway current has formed. However, the ergodic outer region will make the Ohmic current profile contract, which can lead to instabilities that yield large runaway electron losses.},

Improvements in RE beam feedback control have enabled stable confinement of RE beams out to the volt-second limit of the ohmic coil, as well as enabling a ramp down to zero current. Spectroscopic studies of the RE beam have shown that neutrals tend to be excluded from the RE beam centre. Measurements of the RE energy distribution function indicate a broad distribution with mean energy of order several MeV and peak energies of order 30{\textendash}40 MeV. The distribution function appears more skewed towards low energies than expected from avalanche theory. The RE pitch angle appears fairly directed ($\theta$ \~{} 0.2) at high energies and more isotropic at lower energies ($\varepsilon$ {\textless} 100 keV). Collisional dissipation of RE beam current has been studied by massive gas injection of different impurities into RE beams; the equilibrium assimilation of these injected impurities appears to be reasonably well described by radial pressure balance between neutrals and ions. RE current dissipation following massive impurity injection is shown to be more rapid than expected from avalanche theory{\textemdash}this anomalous dissipation may be linked to enhanced radial diffusion caused by the significant quantity of high-Z impurities (typically argon) in the plasma. The final loss of RE beams to the wall has been studied: it was found that conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy is small for RE loss times smaller than the background plasma ohmic decay time of order 1{\textendash}2 ms.},

	abstract = {Experimental observations show that there is a magnetic field threshold for runaway electron generation in tokamak disruptions. In this work, two possible reasons for this threshold are studied. The first possible explanation for these observations is that the runaway beam excites whistler waves that scatter the electrons in velocity space prevents the beam from growing. The growth rates of the most unstable whistler waves are inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength. Taking into account the collisional and convective damping of the waves it is possible to derive a magnetic field threshold below which no runaways are expected. The second possible explanation is the magnetic field dependence of the criterion for substantial runaway production obtained by calculating how many runaway electrons can be produced before the induced toroidal electric field diffuses out of the plasma. It is shown, that even in rapidly cooling plasmas, where hot-tail generation is expected to give rise to substantial runaway population, the whistler waves can stop the runaway formation below a certain magnetic field unless the postdisruption temperature is very low.},

On the other hand, in controlled disruptions with small plasma shifts, qeff easily increases above 8, and runaway electrons are observed even for low current quench rates of 50-100 s-1. Furthermore, it has been found that in these position controlled disruptions the runaway current tail can rapidly decay even for zero or weakly positive plasma surface voltages.

These two complementary approaches yield close results if no magnetic field is present, but there develop discrepancies with growing magnetic field at ion velocities that are lower than, or comparable with, the thermal velocity of the electrons. We show that this is a peculiarity of the Coulomb interaction which requires cutoff procedures to account for its singularity at the origin and its infinite range. The cutoff procedures in the LR and BC treatments are different as the order of integrations in velocity and in ordinary (Fourier) spaces is reversed in both treatments. While BC involves a velocity average of Coulomb logarithms, there appear in LR Coulomb logarithms of velocity averaged cutoffs. The discrepancies between LR and BC vanish, except for small contributions of collective modes, for smoothened potentials that require no cutoffs. This is shown explicitly with the help of an improved BC in which the velocity transfer is treated up to second order in the interaction in Fourier space.},

The electrondistribution function then acquires a high-energy tail which can easily be converted to a burst of runaways by the rising electric field. This process is investigated and simple criteria for its importance are derived.

In the event that disruption avoidance, control, and mitigation schemes fail to avoid or suppress RE generation, active control of the RE beam may be an important line of defense to prevent the rapid, localized deposition of RE beam energy onto vulnerable vessel sections. During and immediately after the current quench, excessive radial compression of the runaway beams is avoided by a combination of techniques, improving the likelihood of the beams surviving this dynamic period without a fast termination. Once stabilized, the runaway beams are held in a steady state (out to the ohmic flux limit) with the application of active plasma current and position controls. Beam interaction with the vessel wall is minimized by avoiding distinct thresholds for enhanced wall interaction at small and large radii, corresponding to inner wall and outer limiter interaction, respectively. Staying within the {\textquotedblleft}safe zone{\textquotedblright} between those radial thresholds allows for the sustainment of long-lived, quiescent runaway beams. The total beam energy and runaway electron population are then dissipated gradually by a controlled ramp-down of the runaway current.},

Understanding the processes involved in the interpenetration between a dense, fast-moving supersonic gas jet and a magnetized plasma is fundamental to the solution of the disruption mitigation problem using massive gas injection. An analytical model was developed that provides the penetration depth of the jet in the CQ discharge. The model developed incorporates the injector, the vacuum space between injector and plasma, and the low beta CQ plasma through which the jet penetrates. The radially moving gas stagnates at some point inside the plasma by formation of a {\textquoteleft}bottle shock{\textquoteright}, resulting in a certain penetration depth. Consistent with experimental findings, it is shown that high fuelling efficiency {\textgreater}70\% and good penetration beyond the q = 2 surface is possible in such plasma discharges, but in normal (unquenched) plasma discharges penetration of dense gas jets will be quite poor. The paper also sheds light on how the external plasma responds to allow interpenetration of perfectly insulating gas jet through a strong magnetic field B 2 /2 $\mu$ 0 >> $\rho$ u 2 . The paper also develops semi-analytical models for the response of the cold, high-current, collision-dominated plasma to the insertion of a dense neutral jet: the propagation of cooling waves out along the magnetic field lines, the heated and ionized surface layer which also expands outwards along the magnetic field lines, and the electrical breakdown of the neutral gas within the jet volume. Although good penetration in the ITER post-TQ discharge can be achieved, the plasma resistivity is only marginally enhanced. This may render repetitive gas inject ineffective, as the concept requires a sizable resistivity enhancement to initiate a current profile contraction, and resulting kink-tearing activity to suppress runaway avalanching.},

The mechanisms of primary and secondary generation of runaway electrons are described and their dynamics during a tokamak disruption is analysed, both in a simple analytical model and through numerical Monte Carlo simulation. A simple criterion for when these mechanisms generate a significant runaway current is derived, and the first self-consistent simulations of the electron kinetics in a tokamak disruption are presented. Radial cross-field diffusion is shown to inhibit runaway avalanches, as indicated in recent experiments on JET and JT-60U. Finally, the physics of relativistic post-disruption runaway electrons is discussed, in particular their slowing down due to emission of synchrotron radiation, and their ability to produce electron{\textendash}positron pairs in collisions with bulk plasma ions and electrons.},

To mitigate the disruption and suppress the runaway beam the application of resonant magnetic perturbations has been suggested. In this work we investigate the effect of resonant magnetic perturbations on the confinement of runaway electrons by simulating their drift orbits in magnetostatic perturbed fields and calculating the orbit losses for various initial energies and magnetic perturbation magnitudes. In the simulations we use a TEXTOR-like configuration and solve the relativistic, gyro-averaged drift equations for the runaway electrons including synchrotron radiation and collisions. The results indicate that runaway electrons are well confined in the core of the device, but the onset time of runaway losses closer to the edge is dependent on the magnetic perturbation level and thereby can affect the maximum runaway current. However, the runaway current damping rate is not sensitive to the magnetic perturbation level, in agreement with experimental observations.},

The charges interact only through electrostatic (logarithmic) potentials. The problem is considered both with and without the guidiiig-centre approximation. With the guiding centre approximation, an appropriate Liouville equation and BBGKV hierarchy predict no approach to thermal equilibrium for the spatially uniform case. For the spatially non-uniform situation, a guiding-centre {\textquoteleft}Vlasov{\textquoteright} equation is discussed, and is solved in special cases. The most interesting features of thermal equilibrium theory (with and without the guiding-centre approximation) are (i) a collapse of the system above a critical value of the plasma parameter, and (ii) a divergence in the electric field fluctuation spectrum (minus the selfenergy terms) for small plasma parameter and very large systems. For the nonequilibrium, non-guiding-centre case, a Boltzmann equation and a Fokker{\textemdash}Planck equation are derived in the appropriate limits. The latter is more tractable than the former, and can be shown to obey conservation laws and an H-theorem, but contains a divergent integral, which must be cut off on physical grounds.

Information about the runaway density and its spatial distribution, as well as the time evolution of the above quantities, can also be deduced. In this paper, we present the synchrotron radiation spectra for typical avalanching runaway electron distributions. Spectra obtained for a distribution of electrons are compared with the emission of mono-energetic electrons with a prescribed pitch-angle. We also examine the effects of magnetic field curvature and analyse the sensitivity of the resulting spectrum to perturbations to the runaway distribution. The implications for the deduced runaway electron parameters are discussed. We compare our calculations to experimental data from DIII-D and estimate the maximum observed runaway energy.},

	abstract = {Starting from the Liouville equation, a chain of equations is obtained by integrating out the coordinates of all but one, two, etc., particles. One ``test\&apos;\&apos; particle is singled out initially. All other ``field\&apos;\&apos; particles are assumed to be initially in thermal equilibrium. In the absence of external fields, the chain of equations is solved by expanding in terms of the parameter g = 1/nL D 3. For the time evolution of the distribution function of the test particle, an equation is obtained whose asymptotic form is of the usual Fokker-Planck type. It is characterized by a frictional-drag force that decelerates the particle, and a fluctuation tensor that produces acceleration and diffusion in velocity space. The expressions for these quantities contain contributions from Coulomb collisions and the emission and absorption of plasma waves. By consideration of a Maxwell distribution of test particles, the total plasma-wave emission is determined. It is related to Landau\&apos;s damping by Kirchoff\&apos;s law. When there is a constant external magnetic field, the problem is characterized by the parameter g, and also the parameter $\lambda$ = $\omega$ c /$\omega$ p . The calculation is made by expanding in terms of g, but all orders of $\lambda$ are retained. To the lowest order in g, the frictional drag and fluctuation tensor are slowly varying functions of $\lambda$. When $\lambda$ << 1, the modification of the collisional-drag force due to the magnetic field, is negligible. There is a significant change in the properties of plasma waves of wavelength greater than the Larmor radius which modifies the force due to plasma-wave emission. When $\lambda$ >> 1, the force due to plasma-wave emission disappears. The collisional force is altered to the extent that the maximum impact parameter is sometimes the Larmor radius instead of the Debye length, or something in between. In the case of a slow ion moving perpendicular to the field, the collisional force is of a qualitatively different form. In addition to the drag force antiparallel to the velocity of the particle, there is a collisional force antiparallel to the Lorentz force. The force arises because the particle and its shield cloud are spiralling about field lines. The force on the particle is equal and opposite to the centripetal force acting on the ``shield cloud.\&apos;\&apos; It is much smaller than the Lorentz force.},

It is shown that the development of instability comprises two stages {\textemdash} isotropization of electrons due to the anomalous Doppler effect and subsequent formation of a plateau on the electron distribution function. It is at the second stage that oscillations of noticeable energy occur. It is demonstrated that the result of quasi-linear relaxation depends substantially on whether or not the oscillations pass out of the resonance region during instability development. The detailed picture which emerged made it possible to evaluate the basic macroscopic effects {\textemdash} the number of trapped electrons and their energy, the magnitude of ion heating and the sign and magnitude of spikes on the voltage curve.

To suppress the runaway beam the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) has been suggested. In this work we investigate the effect of RMPs on the confinement of runaway electrons by simulating their drift orbits in magnetostatic perturbed fields and calculating the transport and orbit losses for various initial energies and different magnetic perturbation configurations. In the simulations we model the ITER RMP configuration and solve the relativistic, gyro-averaged drift equations for the runaway electrons including a time-dependent electric field, radiation losses and collisions. The results indicate that runaway electrons are rapidly lost from regions where the normalized perturbation amplitude $\delta$B/B is larger than 0.1\% in a properly chosen perturbation geometry. This applies to the region outside the radius corresponding to the normalized toroidal flux $\psi$ = 0.5.},

The simulations include a RE confinement model using drift-orbit calculations for test particles. A comparison of limited and diverted plasma shapes is studied in DIII-D simulations, and improved confinement in the limited shape is found due to both spatial localization and reduced toroidal spectrum in the nonlinear MHD activity. C-Mod simulations compare shutdown scenarios in which impurity (Ar) fuelling is concentrated in the edge versus the core, and the confinement of REs in the core is maintained until the onset of the m = 1/n = 1 mode, which is delayed in the case of edge deposition, relative to core deposition. But, the overall RE loss fraction is 100\% regardless of Ar fuelling profile. A comparison of simulations across the three devices points to a trend of increased RE confinement with increasing device size, wherein all REs are lost in C-Mod, all are confined in ITER, and a partial loss is observed in DIII-D. This trend is related to a reduction in the fluctuating field amplitude near the plasma edge during the thermal-quench-induced MHD activity. The result bodes poorly for RE mitigation strategies in ITER that rely on MHD deconfinement of REs.},

	abstract = {Runaway electrons are generated in a magnetized plasma when the parallel electric field exceeds a critical value. For such electrons with energies typically reaching tens of MeV, the Abraham{\textendash}Lorentz{\textendash}Dirac (ALD) radiation force, in reaction to the synchrotron emission, is significant and can be the dominant process limiting electron acceleration. The effect of the ALD force on runaway electron dynamics in a homogeneous plasma is investigated using the relativistic finite-difference Fokker{\textendash}Planck codes LUKE (Decker and Peysson 2004 Report EUR-CEA-FC-1736, Euratom-CEA), and CODE (Landreman et al 2014 Comput. Phys. Commun . 185 847). The time evolution of the distribution function is analyzed as a function of the relevant parameters: parallel electric field, background magnetic field, and effective charge. Under the action of the ALD force, we find that runaway electrons are subject to an energy limit, and that the electron distribution evolves towards a steady-state. In addition, a bump is formed in the tail of the electron distribution function if the electric field is sufficiently strong. The mechanisms leading to the bump formation and energy limit involve both the parallel and perpendicular momentum dynamics; they are described in detail. An estimate for the bump location in momentum space is derived. We observe that the energy of runaway electrons in the bump increases with the electric field amplitude, while the population increases with the bulk electron temperature. The presence of the bump divides the electron distribution into a runaway beam and a bulk population. This mechanism may give rise to beam-plasma types of instabilities that could, in turn, pump energy from runaway electrons and alter their confinement.},

Furthermore, simulations of the full particle motion, including the gyration are performed to check the guiding center approximation. The behavior of drift surfaces and particle orbits in axially symmetric magnetic fields, as predicted in the companion paper are confirmed. This includes the smaller minor radius of a drift surface compared to a magnetic fluxsurface with identical rotational transform, and the decrease of the minor radius of a drift surface with increasing particle energy. Magnetic islands and drift islands appear when the axial symmetry of the magnetic field is broken by harmonic perturbations. In the numerical simulations the amplitudes of the perturbations have been chosen to increase towards the plasma edge. The analytic theory gave predictions of the width of the drift islands that are in good agreement with the numerical simulations. When overlap of the magnetic perturbations introduces stochasticity, the Hamiltonian theory shows that drift islands can exist in the region of stochastic magnetic field lines, which is also confirmed by the numerical simulations.},

The magnetic field itself generates concentric circular flux surfaces. This description enables us to assess the behavior of the drift orbits such that previously unknown details follow almost naturally due to the introduction of higher order terms in the description. The rotational transform of the orbit for a given particle is found to decrease when the particle energy increases and the radius of the particle orbit is almost constant during acceleration. As a consequence, the minor radius of a drift surface with a (fixed) rotational transform 1/q D is always smaller than the radius of the magnetic fluxsurface with q=q D from which the particle started with zero energy. At a critical energy, the drift surface has collapsed to a point in the poloidal cross section. Above this critical energy there is no particle orbit with the commensurate rotational transform 1/q D . When the symmetry of the magnetic field is broken by harmonic perturbations with amplitudes that increase towards the plasma edge, the resonant magnetic surfaces and drift surfaces break up, and form chains of islands. The Hamiltonian description was set up in such a way that it allows the computation of the width of the drift islands.},

It is shown that Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases follows as a particular case, and that, in equilibrium conditions, the theory gives results consistent with statistical mechanics. An integral equation for the radial distribution function is obtained which is the natural generalization of one obtained by Kirkwood for 'rigid spherical molecules'.

	abstract = {Electron cyclotron emission (ECE) at an oblique angle to the magnetic field provides a means of probing the electron distribution function both in energy and physical space through changes in and constraints on the relativistic electron cyclotron resonance condition. Diagnostics based on this Doppler shifted resonance are able to study a variety of electron distributions through changes in the location of the resonance in physical or energy space accomplished by changes in the viewing angle and frequency, and the magnetic field. For the case of observation across a changing magnetic field, such as across the tokamak midplane, the constraint on the resonance condition for real solutions to the dispersion relation can constrain the physical location of optically thin emission. A new Oblique ECE diagnostic was installed and operated on the PBX-M tokamak for the study of energetic electrons during lower hybrid current drive. It has a view 33{\textdegree} with respect to perpendicular in the tokamak midplane, receives second harmonic X-mode emission, and is constrained to receive single pass emission by SiC viewing dumps on the tokamak walls. Spatial localization of optically thin emission from superthermal electrons (50{\textendash}100 keV) was obtained by observation of emission upshifted from a thermal cyclotron harmonic. The localized measurements of the electron energy distribution and the superthermal density profile made by this diagnostic demonstrate its potential to study the spatial transport of energetic electrons on fast magnetohydrodynamic time scales or anomalous diffusion time scales. Oblique ECE can also be used to study electron distributions that may have a slight deviation from a Maxwellian by localizing the emission in energy space. In {\textquotedblleft}near-Maxwellian{\textquotedblright} plasmas, the Doppler broadening of the resonance means that observed oblique ECE from optically thick harmonics will originate from electrons with energies near or slightly above the thermal energy [(1{\textendash}2)vth for example, depending on the observation angle and spatial gradients]. This is different from observed perpendicular ECE from optically thick harmonics that originate from electrons below the thermal energy. Experiments are presently being performed on the Tore Supra tokamak with two oblique views of ECE in equal and opposite toroidal directions (approximately 25{\textdegree} with respect to perpendicular) using two Michelson interferometers capable of observing second and third harmonic emission in X mode.},

With the goal of studying runaway-electron generation with a self-consistent electric-field evolution, we also discuss the implementation of a collision operator that conserves momentum and energy and demonstrate its properties. An operator for avalanche runaway-electron generation, which takes the energy dependence of the scattering cross section and the runaway distribution into account, is investigated. We show that the simplified avalanche model of Rosenbluth and Putvinskii (1997 Nucl. Fusion 37 1355) can give inaccurate results for the avalanche growth rate (either lower or higher) for many parameters, especially when the average runaway energy is modest, such as during the initial phase of the avalanche multiplication.

Detailed phase-space behaviors of runaway electrons are investigated in different dynamical timescales spanning 11 orders. In the small timescale, i.e., the characteristic timescale imposed by Lorentz force, the severely deformed helical trajectory of energetic runaway electron is witnessed. A qualitative analysis of the neoclassical scattering, a kind of collisionless pitch-angle scattering phenomena, is provided when considering the coupling between the rotation of momentum vector and the background magnetic field. In large timescale up to 1 s, it is found that the initial condition of runaway electrons in phase space globally influences the pitch-angle scattering, the momentum evolution, and the loss-gain ratio of runaway energy evidently. However, the initial value has little impact on the synchrotron energy limit. It is also discovered that the parameters of tokamak device, such as the toroidal magnetic field, the loop voltage, the safety factor profile, and the major radius, can modify the synchrotron energy limit and the strength of neoclassical scattering. The maximum runaway energy is also proved to be lower than the synchrotron limit when the magnetic field ripple is considered.},

	abstract = {Energetic electrons are of interest in many types of plasmas, however previous modeling of their properties has been restricted to the use of linear Fokker{\textendash}Planck collision operators or non-relativistic formulations. Here, we describe a fully non-linear kinetic-equation solver, capable of handling large electric-field strengths (compared to the Dreicer field) and relativistic temperatures. This tool allows modeling of the momentum-space dynamics of the electrons in cases where strong departures from Maxwellian distributions may arise. As an example, we consider electron runaway in magnetic-confinement fusion plasmas and describe a transition to electron slide-away at field strengths significantly lower than previously predicted.

Programming language: Matlab

Nature of problem: Solves the Fokker{\textendash}Planck equation for electrons in 2D momentum space in a homogeneous plasma (allowing for magnetization), using a relativistic non-linear electron{\textendash}electron collision operator. Electric-field acceleration, synchrotron-radiation-reaction losses, as well as heat and particle sources are included. Scenarios with time-dependent plasma parameters can be studied.

Solution method: The kinetic equation is represented on a non-uniform 2D finite-difference grid and is evolved using a linearly implicit time-advancement scheme. A mixed finite-difference-Legendre-mode representation is used to obtain the relativistic potentials (analogous to the non-relativistic Rosenbluth potentials) from the distribution.},

	abstract = {Hybrid integration and acceleration techniques are used to speed up the electron guiding centre orbit calculations in a toroidal axisymmetric magnetized plasma in the presence of a dc electric field. Acceleration of the computation is introduced to bridge the gap between the two different time scales: the rapid circulations of the electron around the magnetic axis and the relatively infrequent collisions and slow response to the electric field. The constants of motion method is utilized in correcting the particle position after each guiding centre step, which makes long time steps in the integration possible. The method described is applied to the simulation of reverse runaway electrons in a tokamak plasma. It is shown that in some cases fairly large average acceleration factors (100{\textendash}10000) are acceptable: the statistics for an ensemble of electrons remain correct and the transition of a single electron through the trapped orbit velocity cone is properly described. A good agreement is found with 2-D Fokker-Planck calculations in the straight cylinder approximation for a cold plasma. The finite temperature and toroidal effects on the reverse runaway rate are calculated, and the adverse effects of runaway electrons on current ramp-up in tokamaks are discussed.},

This is achieved by the ARENA code, which is described in the present paper. In this code, the relativistic electron kinetic equation is solved by the Monte Carlo method, supplemented with a weighting scheme to enhance the accuracy of the simulated fast-electron dynamics. Finite elements are employed to solve Maxwell's equations governing the electric field, and this solution is coupled to the Monte Carlo solution of the kinetic equation in a semi-implicit way in order to maintain numerical stability. This numerical scheme thus makes it possible, for the first time, to simulate runaway avalanche kinetics in a disruption self-consistently, accounting both for the acceleration of runaway electrons by the electric field and for the change in the electric field induced by the runaway current. The first results of such a simulation of a JET-like disruption are presented.},

	abstract = {The well observed inward drift of current carrying runaway electrons during runaway plateau phase after disruption is studied by considering the phase space dynamic of runaways in a large aspect ratio toroidal system. We consider the case where the toroidal field is unperturbed and the toroidal symmetry of the system is preserved. The balance between the change in canonical angular momentum and the input of mechanical angular momentum in such a system requires runaways to drift horizontally in configuration space for any given change in momentum space. The dynamic of this drift can be obtained by integrating the modified Euler-Lagrange equation over one bounce time. It is then found that runaway electrons will always drift inward as long as they are decelerating. This drift motion is essentially non-linear, since the current is carried by runaways themselves, and any runaway drift relative to the magnetic axis will cause further displacement of the axis itself. A simplified analytical model is constructed to describe such inward drift both in the ideal wall case and no wall case, and the runaway current center displacement as a function of parallel momentum variation is obtained. The time scale of such displacement is estimated by considering effective radiation drag, which shows reasonable agreement with the observed displacement time scale. This indicates that the phase space dynamic studied here plays a major role in the horizontal displacement of runaway electrons during plateau phase.},

The waves interact and cascade to higher wavenumbers where they eventually energize electrons out of an initially Maxwellian distribution. Coulomb collisions limit the number that are accelerated. As the electrons are driven to higher energy they more readily escape from the acceleration site. Escape limits the efficiency of the acceleration at high energies.

	abstract = {The shapes of three typical examples of electron distribution functions, which have been observed by Helios 2 in the solar wind, are analyzed and compared with theoretical predictions. We have considered a distribution function with a {\textquotedblleft}narrow strahl{\textquotedblright} (narrow beam), which is extremely anisotropic and skewed with respect to the magnetic field direction at particle energies above 100 eV, a distribution function with a {\textquotedblleft}broad strahl{\textquotedblright} (broad beam), which is less anisotropic and skewed, and finally a nearly isotropic distribution function which, however, shows a slight bidirectional anisotropy. The main results are as follows: (1) For each distribution function we may discern a {\textquotedblleft}break,{\textquotedblright} i.e., a sudden change in the slope of the distribution function, separating the {\textquotedblleft}core{\textquotedblright} at lower energies from the {\textquotedblleft}halo{\textquotedblright} at larger energies. For the anisotropic distributions a significant break is observed in velocity directions opposite to the strahl and perpendicular to it but not along the strahl. Here the energy of the break (breakpoint energy) may be determined both by the interplanetary electrostatic potential and by collisions. In contrast, for the nearly isotropic distribution function, a significant break is observed for all velocity directions, and the breakpoint energy may be determined by collisions only. (2) The strahl observed at larger energies in the anisotropic distribution functions can be qualitatively explained by existing theoretical approaches describing the propagation of electrons in the solar wind. However, at least for the distribution function with the broad strahl as well as for the nearly isotropic distribution function, the halo electrons should be scattered by unknown anomalous scattering processes, which do not show a strong energy dependence. (3) For the anisotropic distribution functions we find a velocity shift between the peak of each distribution function and the solar wind bulk velocity, which is typically 100 km s-1 to 300 km s-1. This shift is drastically reduced compared to the shift predicted by exospheric theory, indicating strong frictional processes between electrons and ions. However the results do not settle the question whether this friction is provided by the combined action of wave-particle interactions and Coulomb collisions or by Coulomb collisions only. For the nearly isotropic distribution function this shift is probably not significantly different from zero. In this case it may be determined by some anomalous processes and/or trapping in closed magnetic field structures. (4) For the anisotropic distribution functions the heat flux is carried mainly by the strahl. For the nearly isotropic distribution function most of the heat flux is carried by the core electrons. For this distribution, part of the halo electrons carry heat flux in the opposite direction, and the total heat flux is probably not significantly different from zero. (5) The pitch angle distribution in the energy regime of the halo may provide some indications for the global structure of the magnetic field.},

The critical design issues revolve around two questions: How can the compressed fuel be efficiently assembled? And how can power from the driver be delivered efficiently to the ignition region? Schemes to shorten the distance between the critical surface where the ignitor laser energy is nominally deposited and the ignition region will de discussed. The current status of Fast Ignition research is compared with our requirements for success. Future research directions will also be outlined.},

	abstract = {The shapes of three typical examples of electron distribution functions, which have been observed by Helios 2 in the solar wind, are analyzed and compared with theoretical predictions. We have considered a distribution function with a {\textquotedblleft}narrow strahl{\textquotedblright} (narrow beam), which is extremely anisotropic and skewed with respect to the magnetic field direction at particle energies above 100 eV, a distribution function with a {\textquotedblleft}broad strahl{\textquotedblright} (broad beam), which is less anisotropic and skewed, and finally a nearly isotropic distribution function which, however, shows a slight bidirectional anisotropy. The main results are as follows: (1) For each distribution function we may discern a {\textquotedblleft}break,{\textquotedblright} i.e., a sudden change in the slope of the distribution function, separating the {\textquotedblleft}core{\textquotedblright} at lower energies from the {\textquotedblleft}halo{\textquotedblright} at larger energies. For the anisotropic distributions a significant break is observed in velocity directions opposite to the strahl and perpendicular to it but not along the strahl. Here the energy of the break (breakpoint energy) may be determined both by the interplanetary electrostatic potential and by collisions. In contrast, for the nearly isotropic distribution function, a significant break is observed for all velocity directions, and the breakpoint energy may be determined by collisions only. (2) The strahl observed at larger energies in the anisotropic distribution functions can be qualitatively explained by existing theoretical approaches describing the propagation of electrons in the solar wind. However, at least for the distribution function with the broad strahl as well as for the nearly isotropic distribution function, the halo electrons should be scattered by unknown anomalous scattering processes, which do not show a strong energy dependence. (3) For the anisotropic distribution functions we find a velocity shift between the peak of each distribution function and the solar wind bulk velocity, which is typically 100 km s-1 to 300 km s-1. This shift is drastically reduced compared to the shift predicted by exospheric theory, indicating strong frictional processes between electrons and ions. However the results do not settle the question whether this friction is provided by the combined action of wave-particle interactions and Coulomb collisions or by Coulomb collisions only. For the nearly isotropic distribution function this shift is probably not significantly different from zero. In this case it may be determined by some anomalous processes and/or trapping in closed magnetic field structures. (4) For the anisotropic distribution functions the heat flux is carried mainly by the strahl. For the nearly isotropic distribution function most of the heat flux is carried by the core electrons. For this distribution, part of the halo electrons carry heat flux in the opposite direction, and the total heat flux is probably not significantly different from zero. (5) The pitch angle distribution in the energy regime of the halo may provide some indications for the global structure of the magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Runaway electrons can be generated in tokamak plasmas if the accelerating force from the toroidal electric field exceeds the collisional drag force owing to Coulomb collisions with the background plasma. In ITER, disruptions are expected to generate runaway electrons mainly through knock-on collisions (Hender et al 2007 Nucl. Fusion 47 S128{\textendash}202), where enough momentum can be transferred from existing runaways to slow electrons to transport the latter beyond a critical momentum, setting off an avalanche of runaway electrons. Since knock-on runaways are usually scattered off with a significant perpendicular component of the momentum with respect to the local magnetic field direction, these particles are highly magnetized. Consequently, the momentum dynamics require a full 3D kinetic description, since these electrons are highly sensitive to the magnetic non-uniformity of a toroidal configuration. For this purpose, a bounce-averaged knock-on source term is derived. The generation of runaway electrons from the combined effect of Dreicer mechanism and knock-on collision process is studied with the code LUKE, a solver of the 3D linearized bounce-averaged relativistic electron Fokker{\textendash}Planck equation (Decker and Peysson 2004 DKE: a fast numerical solver for the 3D drift kinetic equation Report EUR-CEA-FC-1736, Euratom-CEA), through the calculation of the response of the electron distribution function to a constant parallel electric field. The model, which has been successfully benchmarked against the standard Dreicer runaway theory now describes the runaway generation by knock-on collisions as proposed by Rosenbluth (Rosenbluth and Putvinski 1997 Nucl. Fusion 37 1355{\textendash}62). This paper shows that the avalanche effect can be important even in non-disruptive scenarios. Runaway formation through knock-on collisions is found to be strongly reduced when taking place off the magnetic axis, since trapped electrons can not contribute to the runaway electron population. Finally, the relative importance of the avalanche mechanism is investigated as a function of the key parameters for runaway electron formation, namely the plasma temperature and the electric field strength. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the LUKE simulations show that in low temperature and electric field the knock-on collisions becomes the dominant source of runaway electrons and can play a significant role for runaway electron generation, including in non-disruptive tokamak scenarios.},

In this paper, these x-ray observations are compared with the relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) model. It is found that for dart leaders the standard RREA model is inconsistent with the observed spectrum and flux of the x-ray emission. This result implies that the cold runaway electron model may be applicable to dart leaders. In this model, runaway electrons are directly accelerated out of the bulk electron population, produced by the ionization of the neutral atoms. However, this mechanism requires an electric field an order-of-magnitude larger than the conventional breakdown field. Because the flux of runaway electrons is very sensitive to the electric field strength, x-ray observations of lightning provide a novel tool for determining the fields associated with the leaders.},

	abstract = {Streamers are thin filamentary plasmas that can initiate spark discharges in relatively short (several centimeters) gaps at near ground pressures and are also known to act as the building blocks of streamer zones of lightning leaders. These streamers at ground pressure, after 1/N scaling with atmospheric air density N, appear to be fully analogous to those documented using telescopic imagers in transient luminous events (TLEs) termed sprites, which occur in the altitude range 40{\textendash}90 km in the Earth's atmosphere above thunderstorms. It is also believed that the filamentary plasma structures observed in some other types of TLEs, which emanate from the tops of thunderclouds and are termed blue jets and gigantic jets, are directly linked to the processes in streamer zones of lightning leaders. Acceleration, expansion, and branching of streamers are commonly observed for a wide range of applied electric fields. Recent analysis of photoionization effects on the propagation of streamers indicates that very high electric field magnitudes \~{}10 Ek, where Ek is the conventional breakdown threshold field defined by the equality of the ionization and dissociative attachment coefficients in air, are generated around the tips of streamers at the stage immediately preceding their branching. This paper describes the formulation of a Monte Carlo model, which is capable of describing electron dynamics in air, including the thermal runaway phenomena, under the influence of an external electric field of an arbitrary strength. Monte Carlo modeling results indicate that the \~{}10 Ek fields are able to accelerate a fraction of low-energy (several eV) streamer tip electrons to energies of \~{}2{\textendash}8 keV. With total potential differences on the order of tens of MV available in streamer zones of lightning leaders, it is proposed that during a highly transient negative corona flash stage of the development of negative stepped leader, electrons with energies 2{\textendash}8 keV ejected from streamer tips near the leader head can be further accelerated to energies of hundreds of keV and possibly to several tens of MeV, depending on the particular magnitude of the leader head potential. It is proposed that these energetic electrons may be responsible (through the {\textquotedblleft}bremsstrahlung{\textquotedblright} process) for the generation of hard X rays observed from ground and satellites preceding lightning discharges or with no association with lightning discharges in cases when the leader process does not culminate in a return stroke. For a lightning leader carrying a current of 100 A, an initial flux of \~{}2{\textendash}8 keV thermal runaway electrons integrated over the cross-sectional area of the leader is estimated to be \~{}1018 s-1, with the number of electrons accelerated to relativistic energies depending on the particular field magnitude and configuration in the leader streamer zone during the negative corona flash stage of the leader development. These thermal runaway electrons could provide an alternate source of relativistic seed electrons which were previously thought to require galactic cosmic rays. The duration of the negative corona flash and associated energetic radiation is estimated to be in the range from \~{}1 $\mu$s to \~{}1 ms depending mostly on the pressure-dependent size of the leader streamer zone.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, we demonstrate that the exponential expansion of streamers propagating in fields higher than the critical fields for stable propagation of streamers of a given polarity leads to the exponential growth of electric potential differences in streamer heads. These electric potential differences are directly related to the energy that thermal runaway electrons can gain once created. Using full energy range relativistic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the exponential growth of potential differences in streamers gives rise to the production of runaway electrons with energies as high as \~{}100 keV, with most of electrons residing in energy range around several tens of keVs. We apply these concepts in the case of lightning stepped leaders during the stage of negative corona flash. The computation of electric field produced by stepped leaders demonstrates for the first time that those energetic electrons are capable of further acceleration up to the MeV energies. Moreover, the flux of runaway electrons produced by streamers suggests that stepped leaders produce a considerable number of energetic electrons, which is in agreement with the number of energetic photons observed from satellites in terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs). The results suggest that previously proposed process of relativistic runaway electron avalanche is difficult to sustain in the low-electric fields observed in thunderclouds and is generally not needed for explanation of TGFs. The present work also gives insights on relations between physical properties of energetic electrons produced in streamers and the internal electrical properties of streamer discharges, which can further help development and interpretation of X-ray diagnostics of these discharges.},

It is found that the recent RHESSI spectrum is not consistent with a source altitude above 24 km but can be well fit by a source in the range of 15{\textendash}21 km, depending upon the electric field geometry of the source. Because 15 km is not unusual for the tops of thunderstorms, especially at low latitudes, and is lower than typical minimum sprite altitudes, the RHESSI data imply that thunderstorms and not sprites may be the source of these TGFs. On the other hand, the soft energy spectrum seen in some BATSE TGFs is inconsistent with such large atmospheric depths, indicating that there may exist two distinct sources of TGFs, with altitudes below 21 km and above 30 km.},

	abstract = {The formation, evolution, and detailed structure of  accretion disks remain poorly understood, with wide implications across a variety of astrophysical disciplines. While the most pressing question -- what causes the high angular momentum fluxes that are necessary  to explain observations? -- is nicely answered by the idea that the disk is turbulent, a more complete grasp of the fundamental processes is necessary to capture the wide variety of behaviors observed in the night sky. This thesis studies the turbulence in ionized accretion disks from a theoretical standpoint, in particular focusing on the generation of magnetic fields in these processes, known as dynamo. Such  fields are expected to be enormously important, both by enabling the magnetorotational instability (which evolves into virulent turbulence), and through large-scale structure formation, which may transport angular momentum in different ways and be fundamental  for the formation of jets. 
								
The central result of this thesis is the suggestion of a new large-scale dynamo mechanism in shear flows -- the ``magnetic shear-current effect'' -- which relies on a positive feedback from small-scale magnetic fields. As well as being a very promising candidate for driving field generation in the central  regions of accretion disks, this effect is interesting because small-scale magnetic fields have historically been considered to have a negative effect on the large-scale dynamo, damping growth and leading to dire predictions for final saturation amplitudes. Given that small-scale fields are ubiquitous in plasma turbulence above moderate Reynolds numbers, the finding that they could instead have a {\textbackslash}emph\{positive\} effect in some situations is interesting from a theoretical and practical standpoint. The effect is studied using direct numerical simulation, analytic techniques, and novel statistical simulation methods. 
								
 
								
In addition to the dynamo, much attention is given to the linear physics of disks and its relevance to turbulence. This is studied using nonmodal stability theory, which both provides a highly intuitive connection between global domains and the commonly studied shearing box, and suggests that transient linear growth can often be more important than spectral instability. These realizations motivate the use of the quasi-linear models that are applied extensively throughout the turbulence and dynamo studies later in the thesis.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016APS..DPPG10096Z},
	abstract = {Kinetic descriptions of RE are usually based on the bounced-averaged 
Fokker-Planck model that determines the PDFs of RE in the 2 dimensional
momentum space. Despite of the simplification involved, the
Fokker-Planck equation can rarely be solved analytically and direct
numerical approaches (e.g., continuum and particle-based Monte Carlo
(MC)) can be time consuming specially in the computation of
asymptotic-type observable including the runaway probability, the
slowing-down and runaway mean times, and the energy limit probability.
Here we present a novel backward MC approach to these problems based on
backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The BSDE model can
simultaneously describe the PDF of RE and the runaway probabilities by
means of the well-known Feynman-Kac theory. The key ingredient of the
backward MC algorithm is to place all the particles in a runaway state
and simulate them backward from the terminal time to the initial time.
As such, our approach can provide much faster convergence than the
brute-force MC methods, which can significantly reduce the number of
particles required to achieve a prescribed accuracy. Moreover, our
algorithm can be parallelized as easy as the direct MC code, which paves
the way for conducting large-scale RE simulation.

This random walk is represented by a diffusion equation in action space.

	abstract = {The formation, evolution, and detailed structure of  accretion disks remain poorly understood, with wide implications across a variety of astrophysical disciplines. While the most pressing question -- what causes the high angular momentum fluxes that are necessary  to explain observations? -- is nicely answered by the idea that the disk is turbulent, a more complete grasp of the fundamental processes is necessary to capture the wide variety of behaviors observed in the night sky. This thesis studies the turbulence in ionized accretion disks from a theoretical standpoint, in particular focusing on the generation of magnetic fields in these processes, known as dynamo. Such  fields are expected to be enormously important, both by enabling the magnetorotational instability (which evolves into virulent turbulence), and through large-scale structure formation, which may transport angular momentum in different ways and be fundamental  for the formation of jets. 
								
The central result of this thesis is the suggestion of a new large-scale dynamo mechanism in shear flows -- the ``magnetic shear-current effect'' -- which relies on a positive feedback from small-scale magnetic fields. As well as being a very promising candidate for driving field generation in the central  regions of accretion disks, this effect is interesting because small-scale magnetic fields have historically been considered to have a negative effect on the large-scale dynamo, damping growth and leading to dire predictions for final saturation amplitudes. Given that small-scale fields are ubiquitous in plasma turbulence above moderate Reynolds numbers, the finding that they could instead have a {\textbackslash}emph\{positive\} effect in some situations is interesting from a theoretical and practical standpoint. The effect is studied using direct numerical simulation, analytic techniques, and novel statistical simulation methods. 
								
 
								
In addition to the dynamo, much attention is given to the linear physics of disks and its relevance to turbulence. This is studied using nonmodal stability theory, which both provides a highly intuitive connection between global domains and the commonly studied shearing box, and suggests that transient linear growth can often be more important than spectral instability. These realizations motivate the use of the quasi-linear models that are applied extensively throughout the turbulence and dynamo studies later in the thesis.},

The FOW modifications are implemented in the formulation of the neutral beam source, collision operator, RF quasilinear diffusion operator, and in synthetic particle diagnostics. The collisional neoclassical radial transport appears naturally in the FOW version due to the orbit-averaging of local collision coefficients coupled with transformation coefficients from local ( R , Z ) coordinates along each guiding-center orbit to the corresponding midplane computational coordinates, where the FPE is solved. In a similar way, the local quasilinear RF diffusion terms give rise to additional radial transport of orbits. We note that the neoclassical results are obtained for {\textquoteleft}full{\textquoteright} orbits, not dependent on a common small orbit-width approximation. Results of validation tests for the FOW version are also presented.},

RE-driven micro-instabilities, such as whistlers and magnetized plasma waves, can cause enhanced RE scattering and thereby alleviate the mitigation problem. This work presents a newly developed ray-tracing code COIN which enables stability analysis of runaway-driven waves in a tokamak. The code uses a standard ray-tracing procedure to calculate a wave-packet trajectory in a realistic plasma equilibrium and integrates the runaway kinetic drive and collisional damping of the wave. This approach captures convective aspects of wave amplification, such as the evolution of the wave vector due to plasma non-uniformity and internal reflection of the wave from the plasma boundary. An illustrative ray-tracing calculation of the instability threshold is presented for ITER-like parameters.},

We also address the effective critical field in the context of a transition from runaway growth to decay. We find agreement with recent experiments, but show that the observation of an elevated effective critical field can mainly be attributed to changes in the momentum-space distribution of runaways, and only to a lesser extent to a de facto change in the critical field.},

Here we detail a framework for this forward calculation, beginning with an efficient numerical method for solving the Fokker{\textendash}Planck equation in the presence of an electric field of arbitrary strength. The approach is continuum (Eulerian), and we employ a relativistic collision operator, valid for arbitrary energies. Both primary and secondary runaway electron generation are included. For cases in which primary generation dominates, a time-independent formulation of the problem is described, requiring only the solution of a single sparse linear system. In the limit of dominant secondary generation, we present the first numerical verification of an analytic model for the distribution function. The numerical electron distribution function in the presence of both primary and secondary generation is then used for calculating the synchrotron emission spectrum of the runaways. It is found that the average synchrotron spectra emitted from realistic distribution functions are not well approximated by the emission of a single electron at the maximum energy.},

Measurements are consistent with theoretical predictions of momentum-space attractors that accumulate runaway electrons. RE distribution functions are measured to shift to a higher energy when the synchrotron force is reduced by decreasing the toroidal magnetic field strength. Increasing the collisional damping by increasing the electron density (at a fixed magnetic and electric field) reduces the energy of the nonmonotonic feature and reduces the HXR growth rate at all energies. Higher-energy HXR growth rates extrapolate to zero at the expected threshold electric field for RE sustainment, while low-energy REs are anomalously lost. The compilation of HXR emission from different sight lines into the plasma yields energy and pitch-angle-resolved RE distributions and demonstrates increasing pitch-angle and radial gradients with energy.},

REs in COMPASS are produced both in low density quiescent discharges and in disruptions triggered by massive gas injection (MGI). The role of the RE seed produced in the beginning of the discharge on the subsequent RE population proved significant. Modulation of the RE losses by MHD instabilities was observed at several characteristic frequencies, as well as by magnetic field oscillations related to power supplies. Magnetic islands seem to suppress the losses as the HXR signal is low and coherent with the island rotation frequency. Moreover, periods of increased losses of REs observed in the current quench (CQ) and early RE beam plateau phase of the MGI disruptions seem to be linked to the bursts of magnetic perturbation, and to the observation of filaments in the fast visible camera images.},

The finite spectral camera range is found to be particularly important, as the radiation from the high-field side can be stronger by a factor \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ than the radiation from the low-field side in DIII-D. By combining a kinetic model of the runaway dynamics with a synthetic synchrotron diagnostic we see that physical processes not described by the kinetic model (such as radial transport) are likely to be limiting the energy of the runaways. We show that a population of runaways with lower dominant energies and larger pitch-angles than those predicted by the kinetic model provide a better match to the synchrotron measurements. Using a new synthetic bremsstrahlung diagnostic we also simulate the view of the Gamma Ray Imager (GRI) diagnostic used at DIII-D to resolve the spatial distribution of runaway-generated bremsstrahlung.},
